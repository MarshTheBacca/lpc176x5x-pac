= LPC176x5x PAC

Peripheral Access Crate for LPC176x5x MCUs.

== Generation

This codebase was produced by patching the link:LPC176x5x_v0.2.svd[LPC176x5x_v0.2.svd] file (https://github.com/cmsis-svd/cmsis-svd/blob/aa4721af946a253d18c8737b01d23e9c88a42e84/data/NXP/LPC176x5x_v0.2.svd[source)]) and using https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust[svd2rust]

The python script modifies hundreds of enums with the same name, `ENUM`. Unfortunately, this was not possible with svdtools, and an https://github.com/rust-embedded/svdtools/issues/294[issue] has been opened.

The link:patch.yaml[patch.yaml] provides a few fixes for duplicate enum variants and other miscellaneous fixes.
